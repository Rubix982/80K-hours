## Building Secure, Ethical, and Open AI Infrastructure

> _“Technology should serve humanity — not control it.”_

---

## 🌍 Vision

I want to work on long-term problems at the intersection of **AI**, **cybersecurity**, and **global economic equity**.

I believe that when used wisely, technology can raise living standards, reduce inequality, and create a world with more leisure, health, and dignity — not just more productivity or control.

Too many security breaches today stem from simple oversights — forgotten credentials, misconfigured infrastructure, unpatched dependencies. The tools to prevent them exist, but they’re often expensive, proprietary, or misaligned with public interest.

My goal is to **build systems that empower the vulnerable**, not just protect the powerful.

## 🧠 What I'm Exploring

If AI continues to advance toward AGI or even strong narrow AI, it must not become another lever of centralized power.

I'm especially interested in building systems that:

- Ask their own questions about suspicious or insecure behavior
- Learn from the environments they defend
- Help small teams and individuals secure themselves with little manual burden
- Are governed transparently and designed for openness, not profit-first incentives

Ultimately, I want AI and security tools to **increase human freedom, leisure, and safety** — not surveillance, labor extraction, or fragility.

## 🔭 Career Paths I'm Considering

Right now, I’m early in this journey. I'm building **career capital** through open learning (see my [security repo](https://github.com/Rubix982/SecChapter)), preparing for an MS in the US, and experimenting with project-based learning around secure infrastructure and AI.

### 1. Researcher or Engineer in AI Security or Alignment (Industry/Nonprofit)
- **Pros**: Access to frontier systems and risks; opportunity to shape the safe development of powerful technologies.
- **Cons**: Competitive entry; institutional constraints may slow innovation or dilute values.

### 2. Founder or Early Engineer at a Mission-Driven Cybersecurity Startup
- **Pros**: High agency; fast iteration; the chance to design ethical systems from scratch.
- **Cons**: Uncertain runway; pressure to raise funding may conflict with values of openness and access.

### 3. Infrastructure & Policy Contributor at a Digital Rights or Open-Source Org
- **Pros**: Combines technical and governance impact; enables global access; helps underserved populations adopt resilient tech.
- **Cons**: Broader influence may be slower or harder to measure; fewer resources than industry.

## 📓 What I'm Doing Now

- 📚 Studying malware analysis, reverse engineering, cloud architecture, and DevSecOps
- 🛠 Maintaining a public repository to learn and document security practices
- 💬 Talking to people who’ve done meaningful, impactful technical work — to better understand where I fit and how I can help

---

## 🙏 What I’m Looking For

What I need most is **mentorship and feedback**:

- Am I thinking clearly about these problems?
- Which skills should I deepen?
- Which environments would accelerate my growth?
- What kind of roles or orgs are best suited to someone with my mindset?

## 🤝 Why I’m Applying to 80,000 Hours

I’m not looking for a rigid career plan — I’m looking for clarity, perspective, and connection with people who care about the long-term future of humanity.

I want to make sure I’m **doing good**, not just doing interesting work.
